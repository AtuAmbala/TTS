top of the imagescreen shot 20210316 at 1 25 53 pmmotivational quote when on chinese learnscreen shot 20210316 at 3 21 24 pmthe file that holds these quotes is here itd be nice to get a few translations in there unless something has changed this doesnt have to be a translation of the english version and the arrays dont need to be the same length so maybe if we could get 10 or so of each type in there more would be better but 10 is probably enough to start yeah those were just placeholders the idea was to have some actual quotes from each language instead of translations of the quotes as they may be lost in of these quotes is currently underway and is being discussed here thanks for the update leonfeng i cant see an obvious way to make use of crowdin for this so as a general approach could we ask proofreaders to take a look and come up with some appropriate replacements ie what leonfeng is doing but for other languages miyaliu666 rafaeldavish what do you sure thing separatorthank leonfeng for translating the quotes ill do proofreading soon as you mentioned on the chinese forum there were some mistakes in the english version could you create an issue so we can modify them before translating thanks againojeytonwilliams we discussed about proofreader onboarding for other languages i think raisedadead will share a plan later each language should have more than one proofreader then they can translate and review the prs just like we do for the chinese version does it make senseseparator we discussed about proofreader onboarding for other languages i think raisedadead will share a plan later each language should have more than one proofreader then they can translate and review the prs just like we do for the chinese version does it make senseit does that makes perfect sense thanks here it is the factchecking is rather slow going though as im literally googling the quotes one by one any idea how we can open this up to contributions assuming anyone

thanks for pointing me to the suggested thread on discourse this is happening because the payload to the api is unable to handle the the length of the uri constructed by the learn app its simply large than the limit set on discourse sidehowever i am of the opinion that increasing the buffer for large uris may not be the solution long term surely it will be a quick fix to this challenge but down the lane when we have challenges that have larger uris we will have to tweak it again also not to mention it may be enabling external spam bots scripts etc on forum which we do not wantthis feature is there just to enable users with the ability to create a post in a prefilled template to help them imho its a nice to have and does not justify the need to tweak the configi think we should strip off the strings to the length required by removing the seed and solution part users will just copy paste it there and we can do this for solutions that exceed a certain limit we are creating the uri hereie this method needs to sanitize strings above a char limitseparatorcc freecodecampdevteam for visibilityseparator imho its a nice to have and does not justify the need to tweak the configas a forum mod it is not just nice to have it is extremely beneficial so we have the full code the user is working withi think we should strip off the strings to the length required by removing the seed

place or somewhere in the modal popup window i would hope in the modal popup window somehow because many users struggle with adding formatted code after the fact in their posts i would say formatting code posted in a users post is one of the top 3 things the mods have to fix on a daily basis if that is not possible then maybe modify the existing forum help markdown template by modifying the current your code so far section as seen belowmdyour code so farwarningthe challenge seed code andor your solution exceeded the maximum length we can port over from the challenge you will need to take an additional step here so the code you wrote presents in an easy to read format please copypaste all the editor code showing in the challenge from where you just linked into the section below marked accordingly and click the save edit button when finishedjsreplace these two sentences with your copied code please leave the js line above and the line belowbecause they allow your code to properly format in the post separatorthe fix should only strip the seed section by calculating the remaining chars in advance of the api requesturi encoding everything else will still be there feel free to test it on any challenge from you local for the workflow to understand this betteragain this is a feature that we would love to support and will work for most challenges baring a few that have really large seed code i would not like to reduce the bestpractice limits for a server we could bump the limit to something that works today but will only break in futurethere will always be tradeoffs imho we are in favor of an inconvenience on some challenges than bumping the limits of the entire foruma more elegant solution is more than welcome thoughseparatorso what about my second option above wouldnt that work for the challenges which are stripped of the code section which is too longseparatoryes i am in favor of something along that randelldawson we should be using a post request to transmit the necessary data instead of encoding it into the uri as a super long query parameter currently after the uri is constructed we are making a get request by opening a new window with the specified uri however large blocks of data like this should be sent with a post request i actually checked and the uri for this particular issue is over 13000 characters while most clientsbrowsers have a default limit of 2083 characterswe would need to tweak the endpoint for the forum that handles requests at that route as it is currently not handling post requests are the server endpoints for the forum somewhere within this repos codebase or is the forum a separate thing i poked around and couldnt find any endpoints dealing with the forum if anybody knows where those are or if we can access them i can take a crack at trying to fix randelldawsonafter playing with this a little more i discovered that the character limit for the uri is currently set to 8138it appears that this problem has occurred in the past and the limit was simply lifted while this is definitely not a good long term solution especially if modifying the necessary forum endpoint proves trivial i went ahead and implemented randells second option aboveif the uri length is greater than 8000 characters an alternative uri is used which populates the forum post with the content randell posted above the pull

operator has an issueuser agent is mozilla50 macintosh intel mac os x 10116 applewebkit53736 khtml like gecko chrome5702987133 safari53736please describe how to reproduce this issue and include links to screenshots if possiblemy codejavascript setupfunction teststrictval if val change this line return equal return not equal change this value to testteststrict10the explanation for the difference between and is incorrect they both test for the data type of the compared elements but does not allow the elements to be converted to other data types if they are not the same where as aka coercion does allow the elements to be converted,agreedreference opening up for suggestions in the verbiage thats simple enough to explain the correct how does this soundthe operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions the strict equality operator will not do the conversion so if two values are not the same type will simply return falseseparatori think in addition to what dakshshah96s suggestion what really helps with this concept are examples something liketypeof 3 return numbertypeof 3 returns string3 3 returns true because javascript is doing a type conversion on the string3 3 returns false because strict equality does not allow the type conversion and as demonstrated in the first two lines of code 3 is a type of number but 3 is a type of stringseparatori agree with dhcodes however i think there should be another module added for users to implement with the equality operator and the strict equality operator in the same module to hit home the difference i think that would be a good place for dhcodes example right now you learn and practice with them separately and it would be good to have a module that you are required to use both to make sure you

operator has an issueuser agent is mozilla50 macintosh intel mac os x 10116 applewebkit53736 khtml like gecko chrome5702987133 safari53736please describe how to reproduce this issue and include links to screenshots if possiblemy codejavascript setupfunction teststrictval if val change this line return equal return not equal change this value to testteststrict10the explanation for the difference between and is incorrect they both test for the data type of the compared elements but does not allow the elements to be converted to other data types if they are not the same where as aka coercion does allow the elements to be converted agreedreference opening up for suggestions in the verbiage thats simple enough to explain the correct how does this soundthe operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions the strict equality operator will not do the conversion so if two values are not the same type will simply return falseseparatori think in addition to what dakshshah96s suggestion what really helps with this concept are examples something liketypeof 3 return numbertypeof 3 returns string3 3 returns true because javascript is doing a type conversion on the string3 3 returns false because strict equality does not allow the type conversion and as demonstrated in the first two lines of code 3 is a type of number but 3 is a type of stringseparatori agree with dhcodes however i think there should be another module added for users to implement with the equality operator and the strict equality operator in the same module to hit home the difference i think that would be a good place for dhcodes example right now you learn and practice with them separately and it would be good to have a module that you are required to use both to make sure you understand the difference between themthese links may also be helpful to include for the new said module they are directly from the ecmascript specification website equality algorithm strict equality

are correct until the cors settings are updated as josephlivengood pointed out for the npm challenges in 13095 i forked your repo for the basic node and express challenges and changed this line of

screenshotsno response system device eg iphone 6 laptop os eg ios 14 windows 10 ubuntu 2004 browser eg chrome safari version eg 22 additional contextthe instructions from what i read confused me to do four tens and add ten percent under each one i was able to find the bug due to this so yay i am pleased to help by doing a total of four i was able to add 50 percent on the last one too my suggestion to fix the sentence on instructions would be to not say make four waves starting at ten instead maybe you could say make four waves start at 10 percent and then for the rest add ten percent to each one for a total of four waves only we should add new test with hint as following you should have 4 waypoints in your keyframehere is the testtsassertnew rulename wavecssruleslengthif you would like to

is using the computed properties but because you can set a minimum font size in the browser this may not work in chrome you can use chromesettingsfonts and set the minimum font size to be greater than 10px if you then run the test it will failchanging the test to use a regex instead might be betterim not sure if this proposed change will fix all problem cases but it will at least take care of any minimum font size set in the browser it should likely also fix any browser compatibility issues i say that because this is one of the challenges where switching browsers often seem to help people pass the test,lasjorg can i look at this issue i was able to replicate the issue in my chrome too lasjorgi also want to point out that the following code passes even if its incorrect because the way we test right nowimg width565 altscreen shot 20190408 at 2 36 36 pm srcseparatori think one possible solution avoiding regex is just have the original style section as p fontsize 30px add media query below and then have the camper change the fontsize to 20px or 25px with the media query the main reason people change this setting to something greater than 10px is because the resolution on many screens is higher than it used to be so 10px seems that is true this will involve changing the that makes sense chaing the size will surely fix the original issue also yes we do have to change the test for fixing the issue i pointed out above can i work fixing both of these issues also do you want me to make a different new issue for the problem i pointed out or is it okay to have pr under this the more i think about this we can not just look at the computed value regardless of the fontsize we are looking for because we dont have a way of mocking the users screen height we really need something like puppeteer to simulate the screen height at below and above 800px to validate the correct size is used i guess we are stuck with using regex for both tests i suggest we also add a new test which validates the normal fontsize for p elements is 20px so the user does not change the seed code then i suggest we rearrange the tests so the current second test becomes the first there is no need to modify the test below because we just want to make sure they are using a media query of any kind and this test does validate that the second test currently the first test is where we will need to make sure the media query is used and that the fontsize will be 10px when the height is less than or equal to 800px text declare a media query for devices with a height less than or equal to 800px

changed but something would need to be changed,we can make it two steps one adding a link and the other deleting ithere is the page here is the markdown file think one of the causes for confusion with this step is that this is the first time we are really asking them to embed one element within another and they dont realize they can do that granted they have been embedding elements within elements all along but each element they have added up to this point has taken up the entire line so i could see that they may think you can only have one element per line now we are asking them to put two elements on the same line one within another we might want to make it clear in the description that this is allowed and that tags can be inserted in the middle of textseparatorheres some more common mistakes they add the link with the cat photos text at the very end of the sentence thus duplicating cat photos in the sentence they add the link with the cat photos text but delete the rest of the sentence so that the only text in the p is cat photos the add the link correctly but include the period inside the anchor tagsseparatorone thing that i noticed is that our description of step 6 less obviously calls out the nesting as a concept which might be contributing to the my first attempt at a new description for step 12you can see the words cat photos underlined next to the image in the preview now thats your link feel free to give it a click so far every element you have added has been on its own line but you can also nest elements on the same line for example you can nest an anchor a element inside of a p element to turn part of the text into a link in the text of your p element turn the words cat photos into a link to the words in the text should stay exactly the same you should only add the opening and closing a tags to create the link after you have created the link in the p element remove the old link below the about this variant it feels not quite there but gives us a bit of a different angle anecdotally i have had good success by saying something like what i added to paragraph 3 you can see the words cat photos underlined next to the image in the preview now thats your link feel free to give it a click you can put an anchor a element inside of your p element to turn part of the text into a link placing one element between the opening and closing tags of another element is called nesting in your p element replace the words cat photos with the entire anchor element on the following line the text of your p element will look the same but the words cat photos will become a link after you have nested the link in the p element remove the old anchor element below the p elementseparator you can put an anchor a element inside of your p element to turn part of the text into a link placing one element between the opening and closing tags of another element is called nestingwe do define nesting now in step 6 but i guess there is nothing wrong with defining it again actually i like this one sentence definition better than what we have in step 6 right now i would vote that we replace the four word sentence definition currently in step 6 with this sentence in your p element replace the words cat photos with the entire anchor element on the following line the text of your p element will look the same but the words cat photos will become a linkthis is exactly what is happening in this step of course but i cant help but feel that it is basically just telling them to copypaste without understanding what they are actually doing i like the idea of telling them to turn the words cat photos into a link so that they have to make the connection between the previous cat photos link they have already created and the new one they need to create in other words they should hopefully realize that they can turn any words into a link by wrapping them in a tagsseparatorim beginning to realize that even though the previous two steps walked them through how to turn a group of words into a link they dont realize that that is what they have just done and so they dont understand what it means to turn the words cat photos into a link perhaps we need to reiterate this a little more clearly in the previous steps you turned the words cat photos into a link by surrounding them with an opening tag and closing tag you can now see the words cat

still experimenting with the feature possibility of refocusing on editor from navigation mode easily with single keyboard press for example e key instead of multiple tabsfrom my quick research there should be no side effects because tabindex1 only makes an element programatically focusable and will not be reachable by sequential keyboard navigation tab keynow regarding my little experiment i think it is better if that feature is discussed more thoroughly in another issue to be able to set focus on editor with reacthotkeys the parent component need to access ref to child componentit can be

the pr however its worth mentioning that the current tests do not verify that any of the solutions actually use the correct sorting method they just check to see that the function sorts an array properly its easy to prevent against using a builtin method like sort but its harder to verify that the user implements the correct sorting method eg bubble vs selection vs merge etctests with more specificity would be possible however some of the methods are inplace whereas others are not and ive seen the more efficient sorting methods merge quicksort tested with larger inputs that the ordinary

info input and info label and add the display property to that new ruleset but the instructions do not make this clear and the alternative solution of adding the display property separately to the existing info input and info label rulesets is being rejected yes the hint does explain that a new ruleset should be created but i think this should be made clear in the instructions since i think a

1933desktop please complete the following information os ubuntu browser firefox version 6901additional contextive been able to reproduce it on freecodecampdev but i could skip only one challenge on my local dev i managed to skip 4 ive digged a bit on this issue and i think the problem is somehow related to this line as this is triggered also when im submitting the finished challengeif i comment that line out everything works fine meaning i can ctrlenter to run the tests and submit and the bug disappear im going to dig a bit more but does that makes any sense to youseparatorthanks for testing our beta version matjack1 and reporting this you rockcc ojeytonwilliams separatorthanks matjack1 it looks like i didnt test the logged out behaviourraisedadead so what do we want to happen for logged out users the issue i see is that it currently says submit and go to the next challenge but clearly they cant submit for now do we just want them to see the same as logged in users and quietly not submitseparatorhere is what i would doimageof course the modal should close as well like you mentioned the signin button can link to signin same as the home page cta and we could remove submit from the first buttonseparatorturns out its not working properly even when the user is logged in i think its a race condition between submitchallenge and executechallenge matjack1 was quite right the problem is on that line it shouldnt be called if the modal is open since its listening to ctrl enter as wellseparatoryes ojeytonwilliams i think its with the ctrl enter in the editor and the ctrl enter in the hotkeyi can give a further look later if you wishseparatorthanks for the offer matjack1 but i think with your help ive fixed it it seemed only fair since i introduced the on its way

so may i just change wrap the content where ever needed or it would be handled in new issue i guess it must be done in other issue as it would be easy to maintain2 i have implemented the children props so may i raise a pr will break this issue in 2 other issues as well 1 for wrapping the places it has been used and 2nd for specifying the direction3 while i was wrapping and trying it out i found out that spacer has been used at every 2nd3rd line of code so do we need such a wrapper which would give spacing to all components present inside it or only to the parent component eg if we have 2 divs wrapped inside spacer then does both div have the spacing around them or only the outmost sorry for the delay it was difficult to understand what you mean without looking at an example of code so to answer you yes the direction will be in a second issue but the spacing and values should still be in this issue so the pages wont look different of course please raise a pr after reading the

really sure how to align it with the crowdin since updated translations should coincide with this change any opinions on thisseparator since updated translations should coincide with this change any opinions on thisdo not worry i think you are putting too much effort into it simply drop the changes to those files and as the bot mentioned they will get updated eventually via our translation workflowas for the bug itselfi am 100 sure at some point we introduced a regression because ctrl enter in addition to the implicit cmd enter was working since the inception of the code do you happen to know if this was just an accident with the new editorto be clear it should always work with ctrl enter regardless of the os in addition to implicitly working with cmd enter just like it was beforeseparatori cant check this myself since i dont have a mac but it should work this is the codeand mot01 could you try and reproduce the ive shot a short video of the behaviour i am seeing if that helps does help yeah it seems to be ignoring the command button entirely which is oddi cant investigate myself but this will help anyone that has access to a macseparatorthanks for the video tugkankibar thumbsup i am 100 sure at some point we introduced a regression do you happen to know if this was just an accident with the new editori dont recall if ctrlenter ever worked on mac i may or may not have ever used it i just hit buttons without looking grimacingface im not sure if you are trying to show something specific with those code snippets ojeytonwilliams thats the code on main which results in the current behavior edit i get it now you were just showing the code and that it should be working i thought you trying to show new changes or somethingheres the current behavior i see all on mac theres some nuancenew rwdexecute only commandenter works on macsubmit enter alone works so any keyenter workslegacy rwd js etcexecute only cmdenter workssubmit enter alone does not work both ctrlenter or commandenter do workmultiple choice python video questionsexecute enter alone does not work ctrlenter and cmdenter worksubmit enter alone does not work both ctrlenter or commandenter do workprojects with url inputs eg front end libs cert project or backend api challenges etcexecute enter alone works cause its a form i suppose which also means any keyenter workssubmit enter alone does not work both ctrlenter or commandenter do workthe last three groups there have the same submit modal so the behavior is the same on all of them what i see is that the submit modal and the video question both allow ctrl or cmd enter we should see what those are doinglooking into to itseparatork i think i found a fixctrlenter works when the hotkeys packagecomponent is used so crtlenter actually does work on the legacy challenges when the instructions are focused when the editor is focused those hotkeys dont get used the actionshotkeys we add to the editor take overi made ctrlenter work when the editor is focused by changing that line 431 ojeytonwilliams mentioned to thiskeybindings monacokeymodctrlcmd monacokeycodeenter monacokeymodwinctrl should work theres a number of actions in that file that use the same hotkeys lines 457 and 469 for example there may be others i think we should be safe to change all thosedo you mind playing with that a bit tugkankibar and updating the pr to make those changesseparatornice work tom i thought ctrlcmd was ctrl or command but it must be ctrl on windows and command on mac manfacepalming i guess this has never worked

to add a tab or remove a tab with shift tab but this effectively creates a tab trap in the editor the solution is to use ctrl m to change the behavior of the tab key so that it instead moves focus to the next focusable element on the page or previous focusable element for shift tab as an alternative you can also use esc to move focus out of the editor but this moves the focus to a wrapper div around main and so you will only be able to tab to focusable elements before the editor but you will never be able to tab to focusable elements after the editor without using ctrl mhowever the ctrl m solution does not always persist for example if you reload the page then the default tab behavior is reinstated because keyboard only users at least those who arent using screen readers will depend entirely on the tab key to access all focusable elements and will need to use the ctrl m solution to reach focusable elements after the editor i think it would be nice if we provided a way to make the users chosen tab behavior permanent on a side note monaco already provides keyboard shortcuts to format the code in the editor so it is not necessary for keyboard only users to switch back to the default tab behavior in order to add leading tabs affected pageany page with the monaco editor steps to reproduce1 using the keyboard hit the tab key until the focus is in the monaco editor if it isnt already2 hit the tab key while focus is in the editor and notice that it adds tabs3 hit ctrl m once to change the tab behavior so that it will now move focus to the next focusable element4 hit tab and notice that the focus moves to the next focusable element5 reload the page and repeat steps 1 and 2 notice that the default tab behavior is back expected behaviori have already implemented a solution to save the users tab preference and have a pr ready to go by creating a new keyboard shortcut that not only toggles between the two tab options just like ctrl m does but also saves the preference to localstorage so that it can persist my original thought was that it would be better to provide a different shortcut and allow ctrl m to work as it always had but now im not so sure and perhaps we should just hijack ctrl m so it saves the users preference my thinking was that if someone accidentally hit ctrl m and didnt know how to change it back they could at least reload the page to get the default tab behavior back but now im thinking this will probably not happen very often and its not worth the possible confusion of having another keyboard shortcut that does the same thing as ctrl m with the addition that it makes the preference permanentid be interested to know which approach you all think is bettera modify the existing ctrl m tab toggle shortcut so that it saves the users preference so we can make it persistb add a new tab toggle shortcut that mimics ctrl m and also saves the users preference so we can make it persist in this solution the original ctrl m would still

meseparatoras someone who is constantly using this site with the keyboard only for accessibility testing i find it very annoying to have to keep doing ctrl m basically i never want the tab key to add

with the keyboard only probably dont want the default tab key behavior either and will appreciate this small changeas far as implementation goes hijacking the current ctrl m hotkey is proving to be much tougher than anticipated monaco does not provide a way to alterextend the default behavior and you cant remove it and replace it with your own implementation because it is built into the accessibility popup menu the one you get when you do alt f1 so im guessing ill have to add a separate keyup listener for ctrl m and do the localstorage management have you tried playing with it might

changing it to the default value seems fine but leaving them as expresssid also works we dont really explain what they are or why they work in the current lessons so it might be best to leave them as

steps we could start with the default value then have a step where learners rename the keys and go into the fact that they should matchi like this idea it could be the default key name initially then by way of explanation we have them change it to match im not sure what a reason would be for changing the key name though i do wonder how likely it is be that you would need to change it its just as likely that express would randomly change it from connectsid just to break thats a good point i also dont know why you would change it from the default value unless you really had to for some reason it could go either way where we start at the default value and just point out that you could change it in certain situations or actually have them change it though it would be rather arbitraryhopefully express doesnt go and change connectsid in some later version and cause bugs if learners update express before startingseparatorhey guysi just finished this project and was stuck with same problem for about an hourthe instructions is still unclear since this issue was openedalso as saintpeter mentioned in this message there is inconsistency between logic of registering user using our app registration form with field username and registration via github oauth where user by guide should be stored in database with field namedo we have any agreement proposals on how this should be fixedseparatorhi nikivan thanks for your feedbacki think a good first step would be to update the wording for this challenge to the following which is based on saintpeters suggestion above be sure to add the key with the cookie name to match the socketio key as well as the store reference to the optionsfor the session middleware near where we set saveuninitialized true this is necessary to tell socketio which session to relate toif youre interested in implementing this fix please check out our documentation here have opened pralso in my humble opinion advanced node and express has at least one more thing to improvetheres no explanation of why do we add store as mongostore and why do we need it i think it would be cool to extract this part into separate lesson and explain difference pros and cons between inmemory by default storage of session versus storing sessions in databasepossible location of this lesson right after set up passportand probably different issue should be opened with proposition to fix this as well as an issue with inconsistency of user names jsuserusername which we store in db when we register user via registration form andjsusernamewhich we

true this is necessary to tell socketio which session to relate toi dont recall hearing the terminology mounted on the app previously and i found it confusing were really talking about changing the options on the sessioni know what you mean about the cut and paste not a whole lot of learning going on here tbh not sure if it is possible to get the average camper to be able to figure these things out its pretty complexseparatorfair enough thank you for these suggestions i would be happy with that wording for bringing this to our attention saintpeter and for all of your helpful suggestionsi went ahead and updated that gist and the ones after to the secret resave true saveuninitialized true cookie secure false key expresssid store storeabout the name of the key i could go either way changing it to the default value seems fine but leaving them as expresssid also works we dont really explain what they are or why they work in the current lessons so it might be best to leave them as is for now then if we go back and break this project down into more steps we could start with the default value then have a step where learners rename the keys and go into the fact that they should matchseparator we dont really explain what they are or why they work in the current lessons so it might be best to leave them as is for now then if we go back and break this project down into more steps we could start with the default value then have a step where learners rename the keys and go into the fact that they should matchi like this idea it could be the default key name initially then by way of explanation we have them change it to match im not sure what a reason would be for changing the key name though i do wonder how likely it is be that you would need to change it its just as likely that express would randomly change it from connectsid just to break thats a good point i also dont know why you would change it from the default value unless you really had to for some reason it could go either way where we start at the default value and just point out that you could change it in certain situations or actually have them change it though it would be rather arbitraryhopefully express doesnt go and change connectsid in some later version and cause bugs if learners update express before startingseparatorhey guysi just finished this project and was stuck with same problem for about an hourthe instructions is still unclear since this issue was openedalso as saintpeter mentioned in this message there is inconsistency between logic of registering user using our app registration form with field username and registration via github oauth where user by guide should be stored in database with field namedo we have any agreement proposals on how this should be fixedseparatorhi nikivan thanks for your feedbacki think a good first step would be to update the wording for this challenge to the following which is based on saintpeters suggestion above be sure to add the key with the cookie name to match the socketio key as well as the store reference to the optionsfor the session middleware near where we set saveuninitialized true this is necessary to tell socketio which session to relate toif youre interested in implementing this fix please check out our documentation here have opened pralso in my humble opinion advanced node and express has at least one more thing to improvetheres no explanation of why do we add store as mongostore and why do we need it i think it would be cool to extract this part into separate lesson and explain difference pros and cons between inmemory by default storage of session versus storing sessions in databasepossible location of this lesson right after set up passportand probably different issue should be opened with proposition to fix this as well as an issue with inconsistency of user names jsuserusername which we store in db when we register user via registration form andjsusernamewhich we store in db when we register user via github oauthseparator,5012.0,1.1666666666666665,0.6875,0.25,0.5833333333333334,7.0,4.0,,3

yesterday thanks for going through this section in such detail thumbsup here are my thoughts tl dr i agree with everything you brought up use dot notation to access the properties of an object tests should pass if someone uses one consolelog statement verify an objects constructor with instanceof we should fix the missing semicolon and be consistent about the way house is defined while there are multiple ways of doing things in js no need to confuse people learning this for the first time understanding own properties on your point about the forin we generally took the view that its okay to use concepts already covered in the curriculum campers can jump around as they want but there is a flow to the topics otherwise challenges can get longrepetitive if they have to recover things before getting to the point that said i think it may be helpful to put in a note right under the example that briefly explains the syntax recall that forin does understand the constructor property agree on your point to add using the constructor in the instructions use inheritance so you dont repeat yourself yup good points to tie the challenges together better inherit behaviors from a supertype we should definitely add the semicolons and the comments are helpful toolet me know if you want to work on these im jumping into another section could work on this in a day or two or we could open this up as help wanted separatorhkuz cool thanks im going to finish up the section add a few more comments if i have any and then we can decide at that point but im thinking opening it up to help wanted will prob be best will keep you posted separator add methods after inheritancethis challenge is slightly confusing because of the following test casejsdog should have the bark method as an own propertythe solution for this part is looking for function consolelogwoofand while does return true so this is of course correct the source of the confusion comes from here which is from iterate over all propertiesimagewith the information campers are given up to this point they would likely assume that to make that test pass they would have to define the bark method directly on the object instance of dog rather than on the prototype the distinction is that for instances of dog bark would not be an own property but that it is an own property of dogprototype so this is a little confusing for someone just getting introduced to these concepts the simplest solution would be to change the test case to sayjsdogprototype should have the bark method as an own propertyalthough maybe a quick explanation is in order to let campers know that a prototype property of a prototype is actually an own property of that prototype wow thats a tongue twister so yeah its a bit confusing and im not

should fix the missing semicolon and be consistent about the way house is defined while there are multiple ways of doing things in js no need to confuse people learning this for the first time understanding own properties on your point about the forin we generally took the view that its okay to use concepts already covered in the curriculum campers can jump around as they want but there is a flow to the topics otherwise challenges can get longrepetitive if they have to recover things before getting to the point that said i think it may be helpful to put in a note right under the example that briefly explains the syntax recall that forin does understand the constructor property agree on your point to add using the constructor in the instructions use inheritance so you dont repeat yourself yup good points to tie the challenges together better inherit behaviors from a supertype we should definitely add the semicolons and the comments are helpful toolet me know if you want to work on these im jumping into another section could work on this in a day or two or we could open this up as help wanted separatorhkuz cool thanks im going to finish up the section add a few more comments if i have any and then we can decide at that point but im thinking opening it up to help wanted will prob be best will keep you posted separator add methods after inheritancethis challenge is slightly confusing because of the following test casejsdog should have the bark method as an own propertythe solution for this part is looking for function consolelogwoofand while does return true so this is of course correct the source of the confusion comes from here which is from iterate over all propertiesimagewith the information campers are given up to this point they would likely assume that to make that test pass they would have to define the bark method directly on the object instance of dog rather than on the prototype the distinction is that for instances of dog bark would not be an own property but that it is an own property of dogprototype so this is a little confusing for someone just getting introduced to these concepts the simplest solution would be to change the test case to sayjsdogprototype should have the bark method as an own propertyalthough maybe a quick explanation is in order to let campers know that a prototype property of a prototype is actually an own property of that prototype wow thats a tongue twister so yeah its a bit confusing and im not sure what the best way to allay that confusion isseparator use closure to protect properties within an object from being modified externally resolved in staging checkmarkbutton small typoimagei think supposed to be outside of birds definition separator,7302.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.5,3.0,2.0,,3

like in the example in the instructions and not do something entirely different ie merging the content of the two arrays into a new the challenge doesnt say anything about using a spread operator instead it asks users to change the nonmutatingpush function so it uses concat to add newitem to the end of original instead of pushpushing an array to an array would produce an array in an array since the concat method is used to merge two or more arrays to replicate the effect of push one needs to put the array about to be pushed into a new array so the outer array gets merged and the inner array stays intactmy suggestion would be if replicating the push behaviour isnt the case but merging the two given arrays the instructions should ask users to change the nonmutatingpush function so it uses concat to merge newitem with original without altering const first and const yeah makes sense to me and since merging two arrays is taught in the previous lesson i think the goal of this lesson is to replicate the behaviour of push using concat in that case my suggestion would be change the nonmutatingpush function so it uses concat to replicate the behaviour of push without altering the

outline color the keyboard focus state on the new rwd steps grid now does not have a large enough color contrast to be accessible when focused on a completed step this is an issue in both light and dark mode in the following images assume step 3 is the blue outline or the light gray background has enough contrast with the original lighter blue background they are replacing to be accessible under neither the blue outline or the dark background has enough contrast with the original dark blue background they are replacing to meet wcag contrast requirementsi didnt want to make a unilateral decision on how to fix this so here are a few options to consider1 move the outline so it is just outside of the step squarefccstep2this is accessible because the blue outline now has enough contrast with the white background it is replacing and as an added bonus the focus ring makes the square appear bigger technically we do not need to have that thin strip of white space between the square and the outline the outline could be right up against the edge of the square i like the white space because i think it makes the outline stand out a little more and makes the square look even bigger this technique will also work in dark mode for the same reasonsfccstep2dark2 change the color of the focus outline so it has more contrast perhaps the same color as the im not that creative so please feel free to suggest something else ifalso while we are fixing this i would recommend we increase the font weight from 700 to 900 and the font size from 13rem to 15rem on the completed steps to make the

currently taking this course i actually googled the following and this discussion came up after that create a nextsongexists constant that checks if a next song exists feels very vaguei wrote const

helpfulseparatorhey gduteaud thanks for your feedbackif you have any more feedback as you go through the course we encourage you to open up an issue on github so we can update the curriculum and make it easier for beginners thumbsup separatoralso just to be clear if we update the test to only check the value contained in nextsongexists it wont matter how you get to the correct valuethat should be our goal let the camper solve this any way they want tobut i agree that part of the sentence should also be updated as i does bring up one issue with the curriculum if we do allow any valid solution the code the camper has written will not be the same code that will be in the next step seed codei think explaining how the code from one step is not carried over to the next step is probably something that would need to be explained to help clear up some confusioni would prefer if we allowed any valid solution when possible but i also think there are times when teaching a specific solution to a problem is ok to do but it must be done deliberately and not as a problemsolving exercise it should be clear one specific solution to a problem is being taught and we should guide them through that solutionseparatorso do we have to allow the camper to write multiple codes that give the same outputfor example 1 const nextsongexists currentsongindex 1 allsongslength true false 2 1 undefinedif both are correct do we have to pass the test

us to have access to iti guess we can have them return the value out of the function so we can test it and then have them remove that return again in the next stepthe is only if we cant test the value and require a fixed solution because if that is the case we cant just ask them to solve a problem yet expect a single fixed solution we would need to include the solution and how to write it as part of the challenge textseparator i guess we can have them return the value out of the function so we can test it and then have them remove that return again in the next stepi like this optionseparatorit does seem like the best optionoh and i forgot about this we should still change this after that create a nextsongexists constant that checks if a next song existsmaybe something like create a nextsongexists constant that contains the boolean value true or false depending on if the next song existsseparatorthat rewording works for meill go ahead and open this up for contribution separatorweighing in as someone currently taking this course i actually googled the following and this discussion came up after that create a nextsongexists constant that checks if a next song exists feels very vaguei wrote const nextsongexists currentsongindex 1 allsongslength true falseand was surprised at the hint suggesting 1 undefined since undefined was barely discussed at all so far in the course hope this feedback is helpfulseparatorhey gduteaud thanks for your feedbackif you have any more feedback as you go through the course we encourage you to open up an issue on github so we can update the curriculum and make it easier for beginners thumbsup separatoralso just to be clear if we update the test to only check the value contained in nextsongexists it wont matter how you get to the correct valuethat should be our goal let the camper solve this any way they want tobut i agree that part of the sentence should also be updated as i does bring up one issue with the curriculum if we do allow any valid solution the code the camper has written will not be the same code that will be in the next step seed codei think explaining how the code from one step is not carried over to the next step is probably something that would need to be explained to help clear up some confusioni would prefer if we allowed any valid solution when possible but i also think there are times when teaching a specific solution to a problem is ok to do but it must be done deliberately and not as a problemsolving exercise it should be clear one specific solution to a problem is being taught and we should guide them through that solutionseparatorso do we have to allow the camper to write multiple codes that give the same outputfor example 1 const nextsongexists currentsongindex 1 allsongslength true false 2 1 undefinedif both are correct do we have to pass the test separator,3578.0,1.0,0.5,0.20833333333333331,0.5,6.0,4.0,,3

and fix this as i mentioned in the pr this still doesnt change the test which requires no single quotes in your codethis single quote requirement came from this issue which essentially states that jquery prefers double quotes however im not aware of any limitation in the challenge tests to detect single quotes i think that requirement was just so that it is easier to detect a specific type of quote rather than build in searching for both double and single quotes plus i think stylistically double quotes are preferredcc im not sure if im missing anything but i think both single and double quotes should be acceptable for this challenge correct me if im wrong otherwise i vote for just modifying the tests and description to accept both single and double quotesseparatori think if we try to enforce style guides then it should be done for all the jquery challenges i thought that this double quote requirement came from some browser specific quirk and since i didnt find any evidence i just

suppressing the updown scroll arrows that the monaco editor providesscrollbar horizontal hidden vertical visible verticalhasarrows false useshadows false getscrollbarwidth wcag 22 sc 257 now requires that any dragging movements must have an alternative single pointer option that allows the user to perform the same functionality as dragging would allow but with only having to use a single pointer input such as an arrow button in this case there is an exception to sc 257 if the dragging mechanism is provided by the browser itself and not modified in any way but the monaco editor implements its own scrolling mechanism and does not rely on the browser to provide scrolling so this exception does not applyan argument could be made that the user is currently able to single click on the scroll gutter either above or below the visible scrolling cursor which allows the editor to scroll with a single click i would argue that this is very close to replacing the dragging movement of the scroll bar except that it does not allow for the finer granularity of scrolling to a precise location in the editor ie the jumps it makes can be very bigbut really we should just do this regardless of what wcag requires because it has the potential to help people who have trouble with dragging movements describe the solution youd likei can think of two approaches here1 enable the arrow buttons to always show in the editor2 allow the user to turn on the arrow buttons as needed how exactly this would be done can be decided belowanother related new wcag requirement is sc 258 target size which requires that the minimum size for a pointer input is 24x24px since the user has the ability to set the width of the scroll bar to 25px and the default arrow buttons provided by monaco are the same width as the scroll bar we are good as far as width is concerned but my testing with the scroll arrows turned on shows that the height of the arrow button does not match the width at 25px it is significantly smaller and thus we would need to do some extra work to make sure the height of the button was also 25pxi am happy to work on this i just need to know which approach we want to take and if it is the second one how we want to implement it describe alternatives youve consideredim not sure i can think of any at this time scrolling seems like an integral part of the editor and there is probably not a

if we combine them that completing the challenges would take much more than two minutes thats true however all the coding interview prep challenges will take anyone more than 2 mins and a decent

combinations of bases and exponents that result in positive fractional powers nevertheless i believe that the above suggestions which can be added to or refactored seems to be a better fix in my

all cases as its written and we should refactor this a bit i think we can take your suggestion to replace the function body entirely with return mathpowb e and just rename the function to something

taking campers an average of 6 minutes and 31 seconds to finish if they finish a lot of them seem to give up according to this table campers spend more time on it than they do on the algorithm challengeswe need to either reword this or simplify the challenge so it can be completed in closer to 3 minutes otherwise we should move it back to the algorithm section,quincylarson imo this challenge is relatively easy its just missing an explanation of some core concepts like function parameters and arguments a similar idea was posted in this issue but as far as im aware a new challenge hasnt been created so far i can work on creating a new challenge which explains this concept if thats okay this new lesson can be introduced before word blanks which would simplify the challenge to a good extentseparatori think the challenge itself is not too hard the instructions just need to be reworded besides the things manishgiri mentioned i think a lot of people struggle because they dont have a cultural context for what mad libs is what a fillintheblank game is once you tell them oh they want you to add the words together to make a sentence that clears up a lot of the misunderstanding separatormargaret2 manishgiri yes that sounds great if you think its a matter of people misunderstanding the challenge then we should make try to make the instructions more clear then we can revisit the challenge after a week and see whether time to complete went i recently went over what you suggested here about an article on hasownproperty would it be better if i create an article for this challenge as well instead of creating a new challenge i think there is already an article about this challenge currently its on the forum and it has been transferred over to guides well redirect campers to the guides version of the article when they click the hint button once guides is live so even with the hint article this challenge is taking much longer than it should i think instead we should try and reword it in a way that is less ambiguous or figure out some other way to make this challenge less difficult especially for campers unfamiliar with the concept of a mad libdo you have any ideas as to how we could make this challenge clearer or i remember being stuck at this challenge for like more than ten minutes although it was trivialthe problem was first getting my head around the mad libs game as i had never heard the name beforesecondly i thought that the resultant sentence was to be meaningful but it was difficult to make meaningful sentence for multiple inputsso i think if the user gets the idea that they just have to include all provided inputs along with any nonempty strings even whitespace between all inputs in the resultit will be a lot ok would you be interested in trying to reword the instructions seed code and tests to make this less ambiguous more than half of campers are outside of the us where mad libs are well known and we dont want to put them at a ive made some modifications to the challenge already ill be submitting the pr soon for you to hi ive made some changes to the challenge description but i thought posting a screenshot would be better and faster to get some feedback instead of submitting a pr directly as the updated description and instructions requires the user to scroll ive added the new content in 2 screenshots 12i think the new description gives a brief overview of what mad libs essentially is and at the same time makes it very clear what the challenge actually expects you to do both these parts are currently missing from the challenge which is what i think makes it so difficult for new campersone last thing earlier i had thought of including a small paragraph on the use of function arguments and function parameters but since the related article on the guides will be live soon andor there will be a new challenge about parameters vs arguments ive left it out although i can add it if you think it would be

blanks challenge is too hard or unclear according to google analytics the word blanks challenge is way too hard and is taking campers an average of 6 minutes and 31 seconds to finish if they finish a lot of them seem to give up according to this table campers spend more time on it than they do on the algorithm challengeswe need to either reword this or simplify the challenge so it can be completed in closer to 3 minutes otherwise we should move it back to the algorithm section quincylarson imo this challenge is relatively easy its just missing an explanation of some core concepts like function parameters and arguments a similar idea was posted in this issue but as far as im aware a new challenge hasnt been created so far i can work on creating a new challenge which explains this concept if thats okay this new lesson can be introduced before word blanks which would simplify the challenge to a good extentseparatori think the challenge itself is not too hard the instructions just need to be reworded besides the things manishgiri mentioned i think a lot of people struggle because they dont have a cultural context for what mad libs is what a fillintheblank game is once you tell them oh they want you to add the words together to make a sentence that clears up a lot of the misunderstanding separatormargaret2 manishgiri yes that sounds great if you think its a matter of people misunderstanding the challenge then we should make try to make the instructions more clear then we can revisit the challenge after a week and see whether time to complete went i recently went over what you suggested here about an article on hasownproperty would it be better if i create an article for this challenge as well instead of creating a new challenge i think there is already an article about this challenge currently its on the forum and it has been transferred over to guides well redirect campers to the guides version of the article when they click the hint button once guides is live so even with the hint article this challenge is taking much longer than it should i think instead we should try and reword it in a way that is less ambiguous or figure out some other way to make this challenge less difficult especially for campers unfamiliar with the concept of a mad libdo you have any ideas as to how we could make this challenge clearer or i remember being stuck at this

to this particular issue looks fairly simple i think that removing lines 8084 from would do it this of course doesnt address the date problem from the other issue i linked but should take care of the

looks like thisimg width1333 altscreen shot 20180929 at 11 54 37 am srcthe one at the top opens as expected my profile if you want to see the problem this issue is a duplicate of the fix to this particular issue looks fairly simple i think that removing lines 8084 from would do it this of course doesnt address the date problem from the other issue i linked but should take care of the nonexistent legacy full stack certim working on getting the app set up locally right now but hitting some roadblocks and may not have time to figure that out and make a pr for thisseparatori would like to take a shot at this if anyone else has not taken it up give it a shot qualitymanifest that other issue seems to be two different issues in one so i will leave this open for now and if it gets fixed we can close this and post over there that the second problem is fixed thanks for posting where the problem isseparatormot01 youre right i should have said they are related rather than calling it a duplicate better to address this issue individuallythank you nischaldutt for taking thisseparatori cannot find the specified file path you help me figure out where is it locatedseparatorah that was from the next branch but it looks like that branch got removed during the major repo overhaul that happened a few days ago described here after some searching of the current code i cant find

isnt live yetseparatorthanks for responding i got it 1 how much longer will it take to be live any ideaseparatorokay i think i finally get it now its pretty confusing with all these changes after the
